# Boreal tree growth reconstruction with a biometric approach.

Codes and Data from:

## Pappas et al., (under review for Agricultural and Forest Meteorology), *Aboveground tree growth is a minor and decoupled fraction of boreal forest carbon input.*

Folder **Code** includes the R scripts for reconstructing aboveground tree live biomass (AGB) and aboveground tree live biomass increments (AGBi) using (1) tree ring widths collected with a C-oriented sampling design and (2) species allometry relating stem diameter with biomass in different tree carbon pools

Folder **data** includes two sub-folders: (1) **generated_data** with the input tree ring width data and the associated metadata (ie., tree core IDs, and tree characteristics such as stem diameter, height, etc.) and (2) **generated_data** with the data generated with the provided codes, namely, reconstructed historical tree stem diameters, based on tree ring widths and bark allometry, cumulative aboveground biomass of the sampled trees, area-based aboveground tree live biomass (AGB) and biomass increments (AGBi)
