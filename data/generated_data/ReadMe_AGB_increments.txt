column description for file 'AGB_increments.csv':
Year	: year ranging from 1980 to 2015
Imean   : mean reconstructed area-based estimates of aboveground biomass increments (AGBi) [g C m–2 yr–1]. This corresponds to the mean estimate from the bootstrapping (i.e., accounting for stand density changes in the observational period)
I5q	: 5 percentile of reconstructed area-based estimates of aboveground biomass increments (AGBi) estimated with bootstrapping
I95	: 95 percentile of reconstructed area-based estimates of aboveground biomass increments (AGBi) estimated with bootstrapping
Istatic	: reconstructed area-based estimates of aboveground biomass increments (AGBi) estimated with with constant stand density throughout the entire period, equal to the one measured in 2015.
sd	: standard deviation of the reconstructed area-based estimates of aboveground biomass increments (AGBi) as estimated from the iterations used in the bootstrapping.
