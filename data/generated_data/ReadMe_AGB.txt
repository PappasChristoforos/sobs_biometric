column description for file 'AGB.csv':
Year	: year ranging from 1980 to 2015
Bmean   : mean reconstructed area-based estimates of cumulative annual aboveground tree biomass AGB [g C m–2]. This corresponds to the mean estimate from the bootstrapping (i.e., accounting for stand density changes in the observational period)
B5q	: 5 percentile of the reconstructed area-based estimates of cumulative annual aboveground tree biomass AGB [g C m–2] estimated with bootstrapping
B95	: 95 percentile of the reconstructed area-based estimates of cumulative annual aboveground tree biomass AGB [g C m–2] estimated with bootstrapping
Bstatic	: reconstructed area-based estimates of cumulative annual aboveground tree biomass AGB [g C m–2] estimated with with constant stand density throughout the entire period, equal to the one measured in 2015.
sd	: standard deviation of the reconstructed area-based estimates of cumulative annual aboveground tree biomass AGB [g C m–2] as estimated from the iterations used in the bootstrapping.
